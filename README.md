To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I follow a simple approach that combines testing, best practices, and ongoing vigilance. First and foremost, I begin with a thorough design phase, outlining the software's functionality and security requirements. I strive to write clean, well-documented code and adhere to coding standards, leveraging tools like linters and code reviews to maintain consistency. Testing is a critical step, encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and security testing such as penetration testing and vulnerability scans. Regular updates and patches are essential to address security vulnerabilities and stay current with best practices. Staying informed about the latest security threats and adopting secure development methodologies, like the OWASP Top Ten, ensures a proactive approach to security. Continuous monitoring and user feedback also play a crucial role in identifying and addressing issues promptly. By consistently applying these principles, I can confidently deliver software that is both functional and secure.

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by clearly documenting the requirements, making sure they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.  I also ivolve users throughout the development process. Conduct usability testing, user interviews, and feedback sessions to ensure that I am on the right track. 

The best way I approach designing software is to understand the problem. Before diving into coding, I thoroughly understand the problem I am trying to solve. From there I talk to stakeholders, gather requirements, and clarify the project's objectives. The better I understand the problem, the more likely I am to design a solution that meets users' needs.
